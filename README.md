_leiptr_ is a Python library designed for efficiency and ease of use, suitable for projects of all sizes. It offers a simple interface that's accessible for beginners, while also providing a comprehensive API for experienced Python developers.

The primary goal of the library is to deliver **lightning-fast** algorithms and data structures.

#### Why Choose _leiptr_ Over Other Libraries?

While other libraries may offer more features, the primary goal of _leiptr_ is to remain minimal and pure, minimizing unnecessary overhead. It serves as both a production-ready data structure or algorithm and a foundational building block for more complex solutions. With support for projects using both pure Python classes and Pydantic, _leiptr_ offers the best of both worlds—whether you prefer clean, minimal code without unnecessary overhead or a more robust approach with extensive validations.
